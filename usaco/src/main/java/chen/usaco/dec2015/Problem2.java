 * Always the troublemaker, Bessie the cow has stolen Farmer John's tractor and
 * taken off down the road! The road is exactly 100 miles long, and Bessie
 * drives the entire length of the road before ultimately being pulled over by a
 * police officer, who gives Bessie a ticket for exceeding the speed limit, for
 * having an expired license, and for operating a motor vehicle while being a
 * cow. While Bessie concedes that the last two tickets are probably valid, she
 * questions whether the police officer was correct in issuing the speeding
 * ticket, and she wants to determine for herself if she has indeed driven
 * faster than the speed limit for part of her journey.
 * 
 * The road is divided into N segments, each described by a positive integer
 * length in miles, as well as an integer speed limit in the range 1â€¦100 miles
 * per hour. As the road is 100 miles long, the lengths of all N segments add up
 * to 100. For example, the road might start with a segment of length 45 miles,
 * with speed limit 70, and then it might end with a segment of length 55 miles,
 * with speed limit 60.
 * 
 * Bessie's journey can also be described by a series of segments, M of them.
 * During each segment, she travels for a certain positive integer number of
 * miles, at a certain integer speed. For example, she might begin by traveling
 * 50 miles at a speed of 65, then another 50 miles at a speed of 55. The
 * lengths of all M segments add to 100 total miles. Farmer John's tractor can
 * drive 100 miles per hour at its fastest.
 * 
 * Given the information above, please determine the maximum amount over the
 * speed limit that Bessie travels during any part of her journey.
 * 
 * INPUT FORMAT (file speeding.in):
 * 
 * The first line of the input contains N and M, separated by a space. The next
 * N lines each contain two integers describing a road segment, giving its
 * length and speed limit.
 * 
 * The next M lines each contain two integers describing a segment in Bessie's
 * journey, giving the length and also the speed at which Bessie was driving.
 * 
 * OUTPUT FORMAT (file speeding.out):
 * 
 * Please output a single line containing the maximum amount over the speed
 * limit Bessie drove during any part of her journey. If she never exceeds the
 * speed limit, please output 0. 
 * 
 * SAMPLE INPUT:
 * 3 3 
 * 40 75 
 * 50 35 
 * 10 45 
 * 40 76 
 * 20 30 
 * 40 40 
 * 
 * SAMPLE OUTPUT:
 * 5 
 * 
 * In this example, the road contains three segments (40 miles at 75 miles per
 * hour, followed by 50 miles at 35 miles per hour, then 10 miles at 45 miles
 * per hour). Bessie drives for three segments (40 miles at 76 miles per hour,
 * 20 miles at 30 miles per hour, and 40 miles at 40 miles per hour). During her
 * first segment, she is slightly over the speed limit, but her last segment is
 * the worst infraction, during part of which she is 5 miles per hour over the
 * speed limit. The correct answer is therefore 5.

/*-
 * Several seasons of hot summers and cold winters have taken their toll on
 * Farmer John's fence, and he decides it is time to repaint it, along with the
 * help of his favorite cow, Bessie. Unfortunately, while Bessie is actually
 * remarkably proficient at painting, she is not as good at understanding Farmer
 * John's instructions. If we regard the fence as a one-dimensional number line,
 * Farmer John paints the interval between x=a and x=b. For example, if a=3 and
 * b=5, then Farmer John paints an interval of length 2. Bessie,
 * misunderstanding Farmer John's instructions, paints the interval from x=c to
 * x=d, which may possibly overlap with part or all of Farmer John's interval.
 * Please determine the total length of fence that is now covered with paint.
 * 
 * INPUT FORMAT (file paint.in):
 * 
 * The first line of the input contains the integers a and b, separated by a
 * space (a<b). The second line contains integers c and d, separated by a space
 * (c<d).
 * 
 * The values of a, b, c, and d all lie in the range 0â€¦100, inclusive.
 * 
 * OUTPUT FORMAT (file paint.out):
 * 
 * Please output a single line containing the total length of the fence covered
 * with paint. 
 * 
 * SAMPLE INPUT:
 * 
 * 7 10 
 * 4 8 
 * 
 * SAMPLE OUTPUT:
 * 6
